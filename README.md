This box is running Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS Server edition and has been configured to work with PHP 7 and RabbitMQ3.6.6(including the development libraries) We've added PHPAMQP1.7 so that all of the required dependencies are present.

It has been build on a static IP 192.168.1.200

**THIS IS A CLEAN DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT**

P.s.  After requests - I've added the .OVA file for VirtualBox too.

Enjoy. ;-P
